 - A tracking tab for seasonal spirits
   - Currently only has travelling and returning spirits since February 15th
   - I am planning on adding the full roster of spirits, prioritizing ones appearing in events
 - A tracking tab for winged lights, so you can check them off as you go and wonder less about which ones you're missing
 - A helper tab for shards
 - A tracking tab for the reoccuring Days events

# Windows SmartScreen

If you get a warning from Windows SmartScreen about the program when you try to open it, that is normal! Unfortunately I don't have the money to buy and maintain certificates for this app, so this is going to be a forever problem. Even if I did get a certificate on the app SmartScreen is likely to continue tagging it as potentially malicious for a long while, though if you have any info about very cheap certs please send it my way as at least then it'll be signed and complain *less*.

# Notes About Spirits

You may notice that not all spirits have exactly the right tree, particularly spirit guides and some of the Days events. I've done some editing in a few places to help condense information and make it easier to record only the most important info, but the effect of this is that some trees don't look quite right. Please drop me a note here or on Discord if you have concerns or notice an error!

# Credit

You can find a copy of this section (minus this note) in the Credits tab in-app.

I created this in the hopes of having a lightweight, non-web app to help track some information in Sky: Children of the Light, a game by thatgamecompany. I and any contributors to this app are not affiliated with them, but the information and graphics are all either directly from or derived from their work.

A secondary reason I created this app is I have some major, fundamental issues with the way Fandom manages the wikis hosted by them. There's lots of information out there, notably about why the Pokemon, Minecraft, Terraria, and Hollow Knight communities moved their wikis off of Fandom. On the other hand, I understand why an established wiki community may not want to move off of Fandom, particularly with how aggressive they are about SEO - my problem is with Fandom, not the contributors to the Sky wiki in any way.

With that said, a lot of the information I've included here is derived or pulled from the Sky fandom wiki. Notably, I've used icons for expressions, cosmetics, seasons, and currency created by contributors to the Sky wiki, and have included them with permission from the administrators. A special thank you to Ray and Morybel who helped me word this section properly!

Finally, there's a few graphics that my husband created for this app: the constellation buttons on the regular spirits page, and the banner on the current season page. He's been the source of a lot of the most user-friendly changes I've made since inception.

If you're looking for a web-based app instead of something you have to download, check out [Sky Planner by Silverfeelin](https://sky-planner.pages.dev/), whose recommendations have brought some excellent QoL to this app. Sky Planner has a bunch of features you definitely should take a peek at, and has been a source of inspiration for me since I learned about it!
