# Notes About Spirits

You may notice that not all spirits have exactly the right tree, particularly spirit guides and some of the Days events. I've done some editing in a few places to help condense information and make it easier to record only the most important info, but the effect of this is that some trees don't look quite right. Please drop me a note here or on Discord if you have concerns or notice an error!
