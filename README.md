# Sky Tracker

Sky Tracker is a lightweight, downloadable, fully offline application designed with completionists in mind as a companion for Sky: Children of the Light by thatgamecompany.

Current features include:
 - Statistics about your progress in spirits and seasons
 - A tracking tab for regular spirits and elders
 - A tab to help keep track of the current season and your progress through it
 - A tracking tab for seasonal spirits
   - Currently only has travelling and returning spirits since February 15th
   - I am planning on adding the full roster of spirits, prioritizing ones appearing in events
 - A tracking tab for winged lights, so you can check them off as you go and wonder less about which ones you're missing
 - A helper tab for shards
 - A tracking tab for the reoccuring Days events

You can check the repository issues for known bugs, upcoming or planned features, or to leave your own comment/question/issue/request!

# Notes About Spirits

You may notice that not all spirits have exactly the right tree, particularly spirit guides and some of the Days events. I've done some editing in a few places to help condense information and make it easier to record only the most important info, but the effect of this is that some trees don't look quite right. Please drop me a note here or on Discord if you have concerns or notice an error!

# Credit

You can find a copy of this section (minus this note) in the Credits tab in-app.

I created this in the hopes of having a lightweight, non-web app to help track some information in Sky: Children of the Light, a game by thatgamecompany. Ultimately, all of the information and graphics here are directly from or derived from their work.

A secondary reason I created this app is I have some major, fundamental issues with the way Fandom manages the wikis hosted by them. There's lots of information out there, notably about why the Pokemon, Minecraft, Terraria, and Hollow Knight communities moved their wikis off of Fandom. You should search those topics for more.

Despite that, a lot of the information I've included here is derived or pulled from the Sky fandom wiki. Notably, I used a lot of icons and graphics created by contributors, especially Morybel, Mimi4117, Jet Lye, and Ray808080.

Finally, there's a few graphics that my husband created for this app: the constellation buttons on the regular spirits page, and the banner on the current season page. He's been the source of a lot of the most user-friendly changes I've made since inception.

While I wasn't aware of it when I started development, since being pointed to it (Sky Planner by Silverfeelin)[https://sky-planner.pages.dev/] has been a big inspiration and where I look to see if I'm providing new, useful work to the community. They've got some features over there that I don't and if you prefer web-based apps it's an excellent option!
